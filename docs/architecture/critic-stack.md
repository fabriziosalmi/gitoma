# Critic stack — composable guards against LLM patch slop

> Living document. Every guard here was added to fix a specific class of
> failure observed live on the [gitoma-bench-ladder](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/gitoma-bench-ladder)
> repo. New guards are added in the same shape: name the failure, name
> the guard, link the bench evidence.

## What this document is

The bench ladder is gitoma's stochasticity treadmill: a series of
synthetic repos (rung-0 through rung-N) with known bugs, run repeatedly
through gitoma with different worker models. Every PR is scored against
a `golden.json` and committed as an immutable scorecard on the ladder
repo's `main` branch.

This doc is the engineering counterpart: for every scorecard regression
we shipped a guard. The order is chronological — each guard was a
response to the prior bench's worst remaining failure.

## Observability primitives

Two universal events hold the stack visible:

| Event | Emitted when | Why it matters |
|-------|--------------|----------------|
| `worker.subtask.failed` | A subtask raises (any cause: JSON parse, patcher rejection, syntax/build retry exhaustion, git refusal) | Pre-2026-04-23 these failures only landed in `state.json`, invisible in the trace JSONL. Reviewers had no way to grep failure modes across runs. |
| `critic_syntax_check.fail` | `validate_post_write_syntax` rejects a patch | Carries `path`, `error`, `attempt`, and `phase` (`worker` or `refiner`). The `phase` tag was added when v16 caught the refiner silently shipping a corrupted file the worker had written correctly. |

Both events compose with the existing critic events
(`critic_panel.review.end`, `critic_devil.finding`, `critic_refiner.kept`,
`critic_qa.answers`) to give a complete picture of why a subtask landed
or failed.

## Guard catalogue (chronological)

Each entry: **what it catches**, **how it works**, **bench evidence**.

### G1 — Build-manifest hard-block

**Catches**: worker over-scoping into build manifests (`pyproject.toml`,
`go.mod`, `Cargo.toml`, `package.json`, `Gemfile`, `pom.xml`, etc.) on
subtasks that didn't ask for it.

**How**: `patcher.apply_patches(allowed_manifests=...)` rejects any
`BUILD_MANIFESTS` filename unless either (a) `compile_fix_mode=True`
forces ALWAYS-reject (the run is supposed to restore source, not
reshape deps), or (b) the planner explicitly puts the manifest filename
in the subtask's `file_hints`, which the worker passes through as the
allow-list.

**Evidence**: rung-3 v11 — worker's correct SQLi fix in `src/db.py`
shipped alongside collateral damage to `pyproject.toml` (broken at
line 19); pytest config-parse failed before any test could run.
Without this guard, scope drift into manifests was the dominant
failure family. Default-on rejection (since rung-3 v11) closed it.

### G2 — Per-file post-write syntax check

**Catches**: syntactically-invalid manifest / config / source files the
LLM wrote, including the planner-SANCTIONED case where a manifest edit
was allowed but the LLM's TOML was still malformed.

**How**: `patcher.validate_post_write_syntax(root, touched)` routes by
extension to a stdlib parser:

- `.toml` → `tomllib`
- `.json` → `json`
- `.yml` / `.yaml` → `yaml.safe_load` (skipped if PyYAML absent)
- `.py` → builtin `compile()`

Returns `(rel_path, parser_msg)` on the FIRST failure, or `None` on
clean. Wired into `worker._apply_with_build_retry` BEFORE the
BuildAnalyzer pass. Treated identically to a build failure: revert +
retry with the parser error injected as feedback.

**Evidence**: rung-3 v12 — planner-SANCTIONED T004 edit on
`pyproject.toml` shipped `source = src` (bare identifier instead of
quoted string). The manifest sanction allow-list let it through; no
parser ran at write time; pytest config-parse failed at runtime.
The post-write syntax check intercepts regardless of sanction state.
v17 caught the same TOML error on retry, then qwen3-8b actually
fixed it on attempt 2 (`critic_build_retry.success`) — first time
the parser-feedback retry recovered.

### G3 — `worker.subtask.failed` trace event

**Catches**: silent worker failures (LLM JSON-emit failure,
all-patches-rejected, syntax/build retry exhaustion, git refusal).

**How**: `run.py`'s `on_subtask_error` callback emits a
`worker.subtask.failed` trace event with `task_id`, `subtask_id`,
`title`, `file_hints`, and the truncated error string. Wrapped in
`try/except` so a trace failure can never kill the run.

**Evidence**: rung-3 v12 — T001-S01 + T001-S02 both failed with
`Could not obtain valid JSON from LLM after 3 attempts` but the
JSONL trace had ZERO worker events. Only `state.json` recorded the
errors. Post-mortem cost was "diff state.json across runs"; now it's
"grep `worker.subtask.failed` in jsonl". v13 immediately surfaced
4 distinct failure modes (JSON-emit, sensitive-path denylist,
syntax-retry-exhausted, unsanctioned-manifest).

### G4 — Worker prompt SCOPE BOUNDARIES

**Catches**: worker over-scoping a "fix bug X in function Y" subtask
into "rewrite the entire module to use a different driver".

**How**: a six-rule block injected into the worker user prompt
BEFORE the JSON schema (so the model has the constraints
internalised before it composes patches):

1. File-fence — don't patch outside `Files to touch`.
2. No new top-level `import`/`use`/`require` unless the task
   explicitly requests a new dependency.
3. No public function signature changes.
4. Don't delete unrelated helpers.
5. Cross-module imports must reference symbols that ACTUALLY EXIST.
6. Minimal-change wins.

Each rule cites its rung-3 evidence by name (e.g. rule 2 names
`sqlite3` → `psycopg2`; rule 4 names `get_conn`/`init_schema`/`seed`).

**Evidence**: rung-3 v13 — qwen3-8b interpreted "Verify Test
Coverage for SQL Injection Fix" as "rewrite db.py from stdlib
sqlite3 to psycopg2". The patch was syntactically valid, the SQL
was correctly parameterised, devil even confirmed the fix — but
psycopg2 wasn't installed and the worker had also deleted helpers
the test fixture relies on. v14 with the scope-fence in place:
worker stayed on stdlib sqlite3 (rule 2 held).

### G5 — Rule 4 WRONG/RIGHT examples

**Catches**: worker emitting a "modify" patch that drops helper
functions because its rewrite "didn't need them", then waving at
the deletion with a comment like `# init_schema and seed remain
unchanged` ABOVE a file body where they're nowhere to be found.

**How**: rule 4 of the SCOPE BOUNDARIES block now contains literal
WRONG and RIGHT example blocks. The WRONG block reproduces the
v14 actual output (the lying comment annotated `← LIE`). The
RIGHT block shows every helper preserved verbatim with the edited
function as the only change. Anti-comment-as-substitute language
follows: *"If you write a comment like `# X remains unchanged` and
X is NOT in your file content above the comment, you are lying.
The parser doesn't read comments; tests will fail at import time."*

**Evidence**: rung-3 v14 → v15. v14 had rule 4 in abstract form;
qwen3-8b read it, agreed, then deleted helpers anyway. v15 with
WRONG/RIGHT examples: same model, same task, every helper
preserved verbatim. **First fully-passing rung-3 PR** (4/4 tests
green). Same WRONG/RIGHT pattern that hardened the Defender
prompt (commit `fc4365e`) ports cleanly to the worker prompt.

### G7 — AST-diff guard (top-level def preservation)

**Catches**: "modify" patches that drop top-level functions / classes
from a Python file. Exactly the rung-3 v14/v17/v18 pattern: worker
emits new content for a file, drops helpers its rewrite "doesn't
need", often with a lying comment like `# X remains unchanged`. New
file parses cleanly → syntax check silent → import/collection breaks
at runtime.

**How**: two new helpers in `patcher.py`:

- `read_modify_originals(root, patches) -> dict[str, str]` captures
  BEFORE-write content of every modify target (pure read).
- `validate_top_level_preservation(root, touched, originals) ->
  tuple[str, set[str]] | None` AST-parses both versions, returns
  `(path, missing_names)` on the FIRST missing top-level def.

Scope: top-level `FunctionDef` / `AsyncFunctionDef` / `ClassDef`
only. Assignments and class methods are deliberately out of scope
(too noisy across legitimate edits). Wired into BOTH the worker's
retry loop AND the refiner's apply path with `critic_ast_diff.fail`
trace events carrying `phase` = `"worker"` or `"refiner"`.

**Evidence**: rung-3 v22 — T001-S03 attempts 1 and 2 both emitted
`tests/test_db.py` missing the `db` fixture + 3 sibling tests.
Retry exhausted, subtask cleanly failed, test file stayed intact.

### G8 — Runtime test regression gate

**Catches**: body-level semantic regressions that every static guard
misses by design. The worker changes a function body, the signature
stays intact (so G7 silent), the file compiles (so BuildAnalyzer
silent), the syntax is valid (so G2 silent) — but the runtime
behaviour breaks a test. Rung-3 v20/v21 dropped
`conn.row_factory = sqlite3.Row` from `get_conn`; caller's
`dict(row)` blew up with `TypeError`. Rung-3 v19 injected a stray
`>` into an SQL string literal; `sqlite3.OperationalError` at DDL
execution.

**How**: `analyzers/test_runner.py:detect_failing_tests` is a
standalone function that reuses the per-language runner + parsers
and returns `set[str] | None` of currently-failing test
identifiers. Worker instance holds a lazy baseline captured before
the first subtask reaches the gate. After each subtask's
apply+syntax+AST+build all pass, re-run tests and compute
`current - baseline`:

- Non-empty set → `critic_test_regression.fail` event + revert +
  retry-with-feedback listing the broken tests.
- Empty set → baseline advances forward (legitimate fixes move
  tests OUT of baseline without triggering false positives).

Returns `None` when toolchain missing / timeout / no recognised
stack → gate silently skipped for the run. Opt-out via
`GITOMA_TEST_REGRESSION_GATE=off`.

**Evidence**: rung-3 v22 (both G7 and G8 live) — T001-S02 attempt 1
broke `test_find_known_user` (row_factory drop). G8 fired →
feedback injected → worker preserved row_factory on attempt 2 →
`critic_build_retry.success`. Same model, same prompt; runtime
feedback forced the fix. End result: **4/4 tests passing,
engineered rather than lucky**.

### G9 — Deterministic post-plan filter against Occam failure history

**Catches**: subtasks whose `file_hints` overlap with paths that have
failed repeatedly in prior runs, blocking them at plan time before the
worker even tries. Rung-3 v24 showed that soft prompt injection alone
(the PRIOR RUNS CONTEXT block) is too gentle — 4B planner read the
log, rephrased the subtask title, kept identical `file_hints`.

**How**: after `planner.plan()` returns, fetch a wide agent-log slice
(`since=7d limit=200`), build a `{path: fail_count}` counter via
`count_failed_hints`, call
`filter_plan_by_failure_history(plan, counter, threshold=2)` which
mutates the plan in place — dropping subtasks whose max-over-hints
count ≥ threshold, and dropping tasks that lose all their subtasks.
Emits `plan.occam_filter` with the summary `{filtered_subtasks,
tasks_dropped, kept_subtasks, total_subtasks, threshold}`. Threshold
via `GITOMA_OCCAM_FILTER_THRESHOLD`, default 2 (clamped ≥ 1).

Two-window design: the planner prompt uses the narrow 24h/20 slice
(fresh for display, <= 15 bullets rendered); G9 uses the wide
7d/200 slice (failure patterns from yesterday are still diagnostic).
Caught live v26b: narrow 24h/20 missed older CI-workflow fails that
had fallen out of the recent-20 slice due to successes pushing them
out.

**Evidence**: rung-3 v27 — `plan.occam_filter` dropped T001-S02
(`tests/test_db.py`, count=3) and T004-S01
(`.github/workflows/ci.yml`, count=5) at plan time. Worker never
tried either. 10 kept / 12 total. Only 1 worker.subtask.failed
(T002-S03 transient JSON-emit). Cleanest rung-3 run of the day.

### G6 — Refiner-phase syntax check

**Catches**: refiner's apply path silently corrupting working code.
The refiner runs after the panel + devil and emits patches against
devil findings; its output went straight to `git commit` without
any syntax validation.

**How**: `validate_post_write_syntax` extended to cover `.py` via
builtin `compile()`. `run.py`'s refiner block invokes the helper
after `apply_patches`. On failure: emit `critic_syntax_check.fail`
with `phase="refiner"`, hard-reset the worktree to v0, emit
`critic_refiner.reverted` with rationale
`syntax_check_failed: PATH: ERROR`, and skip meta-eval entirely (a broken patch can
never be a refinement, no judge needed).

**Evidence**: rung-3 v16 — refiner changed a Python triple-quote
opener to an empty-string-plus-bare-bracket sequence in
`src/db.py`, breaking pytest collection. The corruption shipped
because refiner bypasses worker.py's `_apply_with_build_retry`.
v17 with G6 in place: same identical bug intercepted —
`critic_syntax_check.fail phase=refiner` fired on src/db.py line
17, reverted to v0, src/db.py final state = correct worker SQLi
fix preserved.

### G10 — Semantic config schema validator

**Catches**: configs that parse as valid JSON/YAML/TOML but don't
match the consuming tool's own schema. The b2v PR #19 case:
`.eslintrc.json` shipped with `"parser": {"parser": "..."}`
(object where ESLint expects a string) plus invented options on
`@typescript-eslint/explicit-module-boundary-types`. File parses
clean → G2 silent → ESLint refuses to load it at runtime.

**Mechanism**: `gitoma/worker/schema_validator.py` ships ~860KB of
schemastore.org schemas under `gitoma/worker/schemas/` (ESLint,
Prettier, package.json, tsconfig, github-workflow, dependabot,
Cargo). On every apply, files matching `PATH_MATCHERS` are
validated against their bundled schema via `jsonschema`. A
permissive offline registry resolves cross-schema `$ref`s without
network access. Same revert+retry shape as G2.

A custom YAML loader excludes `on/off/yes/no` from the boolean
resolver so GitHub Actions workflows (which use `on:` as a
trigger key) keep `on` as a string instead of being parsed as
Python `True`. Without this, every workflow file would fail
validation against the github-workflow schema.

**Wired both worker and refiner apply paths.**

### G11 — Content-grounding against repo fingerprint

**Catches**: documentation files that make claims contradicting the
repo's actual stack. The b2v PR #21 case: a generated
`docs/guide/architecture.md` claimed React + Redux + WebSocket
frontend for a pure-Rust CLI repo (clap/serde/tokio). Every
structural guard (G1-G10) silent — the file parses clean, isn't a
known config, isn't Python so AST-diff doesn't apply, doesn't
break the build, doesn't fail tests. The hallucination is purely
*semantic*.

**Mechanism**: `gitoma/worker/content_grounding.py` consumes
Occam Observer's new `GET /repo/fingerprint` endpoint (declared
deps per language, inferred frameworks, manifest files,
entrypoints). For every touched `.md/.mdx/.rst/.txt` file, it
greps a 42-pattern map of canonical framework names (React, Vue,
Django, FastAPI, Clap, Cobra, …) against the doc content. A match
that doesn't appear in `declared_frameworks` OR any
`declared_deps[lang]` entry triggers revert+retry with the
violation injected as feedback.

**Two-sided integration**:

- *Planner-side*: the same fingerprint also renders into a
  `== REPO FINGERPRINT (GROUND TRUTH — verified by Occam) ==`
  block injected into the planner user prompt, telling the
  planner NOT to propose subtasks that introduce frameworks/deps
  absent from the lists. Catches at plan time what G11 catches at
  apply time — cheaper to prevent than to revert. The fingerprint
  is fetched ONCE per run by `cli/commands/run.py` and shared
  with both the planner call and the worker apply loop, so the
  consumer-side cost is one extra local HTTP roundtrip.

- *Worker/refiner-side*: G11 fires in the apply loop right after
  G10 (schema check), in both the worker (`worker/worker.py`) and
  the refiner (`cli/commands/run.py`).

**Silent pass** (no error) when:

- Occam disabled (`OCCAM_URL` unset) → fingerprint is `None`.
- Occam reachable but `manifest_files` empty → greenfield repo,
  nothing to ground against (avoids false-positives on brand-new
  projects).
- File extension not in `DOC_EXTENSIONS`.
- No framework keyword matches in the file.
- Every match resolves against the fingerprint
  (`declared_frameworks` exact, `declared_deps` exact, OR a dep
  name that contains the framework id — handles
  `@reduxjs/toolkit` grounding "Redux" without listing every
  scope variant).

**Out of scope for v1** (deferred):

- Source-code grounding (function-name existence checks) — needs
  a symbol index across the repo.
- ~~JS config plugin grounding~~ — **shipped as G12 below**.
- Negative claims ("Unlike React, we use vanilla DOM") — accepted
  as a known low-volume false-positive; revisit if FP rate climbs.

### G12 — Config-grounding for JS/TS configs

**Catches**: JS/TS config files (`prettier.config.js`,
`tailwind.config.js`, `vite.config.ts`, etc.) that reference npm
packages absent from `package.json`. The b2v PR #21 case had this
failure mode side-by-side with the doc hallucination G11 catches:
the generated `prettier.config.js` shipped
`plugins: ['prettier-plugin-tailwindcss']` but b2v's `package.json`
only declares `vitepress` — the plugin reference would fail at
prettier load time. Every prior structural guard silent.

**Mechanism**: `gitoma/worker/config_grounding.py` matches files
by basename against a closed `CONFIG_FILE_BASENAMES` set (47
entries — Prettier, ESLint, Tailwind, Vite, Webpack, Jest,
Playwright, Next, Nuxt, Astro, Svelte, PostCSS, Babel).
Three extractors collect package references:

- `require('pkg')` — CommonJS form
- `import x from 'pkg'` / `import 'pkg'` — ESM form
- `plugins: [...]` / `presets: [...]` — string-literal arrays
  (this is the PR #21 shape — the offending plugin was a string
  in the array, not an import)

Each extracted reference is normalised
(`@scope/pkg/sub` → `@scope/pkg`, `lodash/fp` → `lodash`),
filtered against an 84-entry `NODE_BUILTINS` set (`fs`,
`path`, …, including the `node:` prefix variants), and
relative/absolute paths are skipped. The remaining package names
are membership-tested against
`fingerprint['declared_deps']['npm']`. First miss → revert+retry.

**Closed scope on purpose**: greping every `.js` file in the repo
for package references would be a false-positive minefield —
application code legitimately calls `require('lodash')` even when
that dep isn't yet declared (the developer is mid-edit, npm will
flag it at install time). G12 only fires on files we're certain
are configs.

**Silent pass** when:

- Fingerprint is `None` / empty / no `package.json` declared
  (pure-Rust/Python/Go projects that happen to ship a config
  file get a free pass — extending grounding to them is a
  conscious deferred decision, not a default)
- File basename not in `CONFIG_FILE_BASENAMES`
- Every extracted reference resolves against npm deps OR is a
  Node builtin OR is a relative/absolute path

**Wired both worker and refiner apply paths.**

### G13 — Doc-preservation against fenced code-block destruction

**Catches**: MODIFY operations on doc files (`.md`/`.mdx`/`.rst`/
`.txt`) that destroy fenced code-block content. The recurring
b2v failure mode across PRs #24/#26/#27 (and pre-#22 manual fix):
README's bash examples either get deleted entirely, replaced
with prose pointing to non-existent docs, or corrupted with
literal `\n` text instead of real newlines (the qwen3-8b PR #27
escape-sequence corruption signature).

Three of four shipped PRs over 48 hours had this regression in
some form, with self-review catching it only 1 of 4 times.
Models from gemma-2B to qwen3-8B all produced one variant — it's
a class of failure the LLM-judgement layer can't reliably
distinguish from "improvement". Needed a deterministic check.

**Mechanism**: `gitoma/worker/doc_preservation.py` runs two
checks per touched doc file (skipping CREATE / DELETE / non-doc
extensions):

1. **Code-block character preservation**: count chars inside
   ``` ```...``` ``` blocks in original vs new; flag when new
   has < 30% of original AND original was ≥ 50 chars (the
   minimum-interesting threshold). Conservative: legitimate
   consolidation (50% loss) still passes.

2. **Literal `\n` corruption**: any line inside a fenced block
   containing 2+ literal `\n` text occurrences flags. Catches
   the JSON-double-escape pattern where worker emits `\\n` in
   patch JSON (decodes to literal 2-char `\n`) instead of real
   newlines. Threshold of 2+ avoids false-positives on legit
   single-`\n` (regex examples, printf format strings).

Same revert+retry shape as G2/G7/G10/G11/G12. Pure-string
implementation (no LLM, no parsing libraries beyond stdlib
`re`). Reads `originals` dict captured by `read_modify_originals`
— the same one G7 consumes.

**Out of scope for v1** (deferred):
- URL/path reachability (added doc URLs that don't resolve, or
  cite local files that don't exist) — G14 candidate, requires
  DNS or filesystem checks.
- Prose drift (paragraphs replaced with vapid summaries) — too
  subjective for a deterministic guard.

**Wired both worker and refiner apply paths.**

### G14 — URL/path grounding against fabricated link targets

**Catches**: MODIFY operations on doc files (`.md`/`.mdx`/`.rst`/
`.txt`) that introduce links pointing at URLs/paths which don't
exist. The closing piece of the content-grounding trilogy
(G11 frameworks, G12 npm package refs, G13 code-block
preservation, G14 link targets).

Two real-world failure shapes G14 catches:

1. **Invented external hostnames** — b2v PR #24:
   `https://b2v.github.io/docs/architecture.md`. The
   `b2v.github.io` subdomain has no GitHub Pages site published.
   A naive DNS check passes (GitHub wildcard-resolves `*.github.io`)
   but a HEAD request returns 404. G14's two-tier check (DNS →
   HEAD) catches it.

2. **Invented relative paths** — b2v PR #27:
   `docs/guide/code/encoder.md`, `docs/guide/code/decoder.md`,
   `docs/guide/code/utils.md`. Three Markdown links to files that
   don't exist anywhere in the repo. Pure filesystem check
   (relative to the doc OR relative to repo root) catches it.

**Mechanism**: `gitoma/worker/url_grounding.py`. For each touched
doc file, diff added URLs/links vs the original content (carry-
overs are exempt — not the worker's invention). Then:

- For each added `https?://` URL: DNS-resolve hostname, then
  HEAD with status check. Definitive 404 → flag. Anything else
  (5xx, 405, timeout, SSL) → fail-open.
- For each added Markdown link `[text](target)`: skip if
  `http://`, `https://`, `mailto:`, `tel:`, `<...>`, or `#anchor`.
  Otherwise check existence relative to doc directory AND repo
  root. Both fail → flag.

**Opt-out**: `GITOMA_URL_GROUNDING_OFFLINE=true` for runs in
sandboxed CI envs without network access.

**Wired both worker and refiner apply paths.**

**Out of scope for v1** (deferred):
- Path-level HTTP 404 detection on real domains (e.g.
  `https://github.com/INVENTED/REPO`) — would need full HTTP
  for every URL, too slow at scale.
- Image references (`![](src)`) — same regex would work but
  not yet wired; defer until evidence of image hallucination.
- Cross-link validation (anchor `#section` actually exists in
  target file) — adds parsing complexity for marginal coverage.

### G20 — TOML/INI syntax validation

**Catches**: patches that introduce parse-level syntax errors in
config files (broken `pyproject.toml`, `setup.cfg`, `tox.ini`,
`.ruff.toml`, `Cargo.toml`, etc.). Closes the bench-blast PR #1
failure mode (closed 2026-04-26): the entire G1–G15 stack +
the LLM self-critic shipped a PR with 3 syntax errors in
configs, because no guard ran the parser.

**Mechanism**: `gitoma/worker/config_syntax.py`. For each touched
file, classify by basename or extension:

- TOML family: `pyproject.toml`, `.ruff.toml`, `ruff.toml`,
  `uv.toml`, `mypy.toml`, `rustfmt.toml`, `clippy.toml`,
  `Cargo.toml`, plus generic `*.toml`. Parsed via stdlib
  `tomllib.loads`.
- INI family: `setup.cfg`, `tox.ini`, `.flake8`, `.pylintrc`,
  `.coveragerc`, `mypy.ini`, `.isort.cfg`, plus generic `*.ini`
  / `*.cfg`. Parsed via stdlib `configparser` (with
  `strict=True` so duplicate sections / options raise).

Files outside both families are skipped. Errors aggregated
across all touched configs into ONE `ConfigSyntaxResult` so
the LLM retry sees the full picture in a single feedback round.
Line/column extracted from parser messages where present.

**Wired between G15 (sibling-config) and G18/G19 (orphan
symbols)** in the worker, same revert+retry shape as the rest
of the stack. No env opt-in/out — deterministic and cheap (one
stdlib parse per file), defaults on.

**Documented lenience**: stdlib `tomllib` accepts leading
whitespace on keys (some external TOML parsers in the wild are
stricter). G20 catches actual syntax errors only — not cosmetic
indentation. Pinned in test
`tests/test_config_syntax.py::test_toml_leading_whitespace_is_lenient`.

**Out of scope for v1** (deferred):
- Schema validation (already covered by G10 / `validate_config_semantics`
  for the schemas it knows: ESLint, Prettier, tsconfig, package.json,
  GitHub workflow, dependabot, Cargo).
- YAML / JSON syntax (already covered upstream by
  `validate_post_write_syntax`).
- Cross-config consistency (already covered by G15 for the
  JS/TS quality-config family).

## Plan-time deterministic post-processors (Layer-A + Layer-B)

Two LLM-free transformations applied to the plan AFTER the LLM
planner returns and AS PART of the post-plan pipeline (sequenced
between the existing Layer-2 test→source rewrite and G9 Occam
filter). The principle: closing the planner's most reliable
mistakes deterministically is cheaper than catching the resulting
worker patches downstream with guards.

### Layer-A — `synthesize_real_bug_task`

**Catches**: the rung-0 pattern (memory:
`project_backlog_planner_focus_real_bug`) where the planner emits
12 generic-project subtasks and never touches the actual broken
file. Even with the prompt's HARD RULE for failing tests, small
models routinely propose docs/CI/lint subtasks instead of reading
the failing-test paths and fixing the source.

**Mechanism**: when `test_results.status == "fail"` AND failing
test paths are extractable from `details` bullets AND none of the
existing plan tasks have file_hints matching any source-under-test
mapped from those tests, synthesize a priority-1 `T000` task and
prepend. Reuses existing `infer_source_files_from_tests` from
`test_to_source.py`. Caps at 4 subtasks per synthesized task.

Fires only when the planner genuinely missed it — if any existing
task already covers a mapped source file, no synthesis (Layer-A
respects the planner's intent when the intent is sound).

### Layer-B — `banish_readme_only_subtasks`

**Catches**: the recurring b2v PR #24/#26/#27 pattern (3 of 4
shipped PRs across model sizes) where the planner invents an
"Update README" subtask whose only file_hint is `README.md`, then
the worker mishandles it (deletes bash blocks, corrupts content,
adds invented links). User principle 2026-04-25: README updates
are a CONSEQUENCE of code changes, not a primary planning goal;
in practice legitimate doc improvements live in `docs/`, not
README.

**Mechanism**: drop every subtask whose file_hints list contains
ONLY README variants (`README.md`, `README.rst`, `README`,
`Readme.md`, etc.), UNLESS the Documentation metric is failing
AND its details explicitly cite README. Multi-file_hint subtasks
(README + a code file) are kept — those represent legitimate
"document this change" intent. Tasks left empty after banishment
are also removed from the plan.

Composed with Layer-A: synthesize the real-bug task, THEN drop
hallucinated README work. Both deterministic, no LLM, fast (<10ms).

**Composability with G13/G14**: the README-destruction guards
become a SAFETY NET for the cases where a README subtask DOES
slip through (multi-hint that legitimately includes README, or
genuine Documentation-cited cases). Layer-B is the first line.

## Ψ-lite — universal fitness function (Γ + Ω components)

**Catches**: patches that survive every binary structural guard
(G1-G14, BuildAnalyzer, G8 test regression) but score low on
quality heuristics. Validated empirically: morning's PR #27
README (literal `\n` corruption + invented `b2v.github.io` URLs)
passed every guard except G14 (which only fired on the URL part);
Ψ-lite would have blocked the entire patch with `Ω=0.60` slop
score → `Ψ=0.40 < 0.5` threshold.

**Mechanism**: pure-math, no LLM, no network. Two component
scores per touched file, aggregated `min` across files:

- **Γ (grounding)**: fraction of "evidence tokens" (framework
  mentions in docs via G11's pattern map, package refs in JS
  configs via G12's extractor) that are GROUNDED in the
  fingerprint's declared deps + frameworks. Source files return
  1.0 (no Γ signal in Ψ-lite — CPG-lite would add it). Returns
  1.0 when no evidence tokens to score (presume innocent).

- **Ω (slop)**: heuristic count of known-bad surface patterns,
  normalised 0-1:
  - Literal `\n` text inside fenced code blocks (each occurrence
    contributes; 3+ on a line = 0.5 cap per block)
  - Triple-blank-line runs (each = 0.05, capped 0.3)
  - Trailing whitespace fraction (capped 0.2)
  - Source file (`.py/.rs/.ts` etc.) wrapped in markdown fence
    (0.6 — strong signal of "model returned wrong format")
  - Near-empty post-modify on source file (0.4)

Final score: `Ψ = α·Γ - λ·Ω`. Defaults `α=1.0, λ=1.0,
threshold=0.5` — semantically "grounding and slop equally
weighted, patch must score at least half". Aggregated `min`
across touched files (worst file dominates).

**Position in pipeline**: BETWEEN structural guards (G2/G7/G10/
G11/G12/G13/G14, BuildAnalyzer, G8 test regression) and LLM
critics (panel, devil, Q&A). On low Ψ → revert+retry without
burning critic LLM tokens. Saves cost on borderline patches.

**Calibration data** (b2v PRs measured 2026-04-26 AM):
- PR #28/#29/#30 (clean post-stack PRs): Ψ ∈ [0.935, 1.000]
- PR #27 README (morning destroyed): Ψ = 0.400 → would BLOCK
- Synthetic React-in-Rust hallucination: Ψ = 0.000 → would BLOCK

**Opt-in via `GITOMA_PSI_LITE=on`** (default off — feature is new
enough that we want operator consent before changing the gate
behavior). Threshold/weights tunable via
`GITOMA_PSI_LITE_THRESHOLD`, `GITOMA_PSI_ALPHA`, `GITOMA_PSI_LAMBDA`.
Trace events: `psi_lite.scored` (always when enabled),
`critic_psi_lite.fail` (on block).

**What Ψ-lite is NOT**:
- It's NOT a replacement for the structural guards — they catch
  hard binary failures (broken syntax, dropped functions, fake
  URLs). Ψ-lite catches gradient quality issues.
- It's NOT the full horizon Ψ (which adds Φ semantic-fitness +
  ΔI information-gain via CPG). Lite version is Γ + Ω only.
- It's NOT wired to the refiner apply path (only worker apply
  for v1). Refiner gets Ψ telemetry but no gate yet.

## Q&A self-consistency phase (orthogonal to the stack)

Not a guard against worker slop — a separate post-meta gate that asks
the patch three structured questions and gates revisions on a
BuildAnalyzer + test pass. Touched today only for visibility:

- **Crash → PR body annotation** (commit `a5f0ce3`). Until now, a
  Q&A phase that crashed mid-flight produced an empty PR-body
  section that looked identical to a successful Q&A pass.
  Reviewer had no flag. The crash branch now emits a
  `## [!] Q&A self-consistency phase CRASHED` block with the first
  line of the crash reason and "Treat this PR as ungated"
  language.
- See `qa-workflow.md` (TBD — page not yet authored) for the full phase.

## In-process JSON repair (orthogonal)

`_attempt_json_repair` runs ONCE between the first `json.loads`
failure and the retry-with-correction-turn path. Two string-aware
passes:

1. `_strip_trailing_commas` — drop `,` immediately preceding `}`/`]`,
   string-aware so content like `"hello,}"` survives.
2. `_escape_bare_quotes` — escape unescaped quotes inside string
   values. The opener is the first `"` after structural punctuation;
   the closer is a quote followed by `,`/`:`/`}`/`]`/EOF. Quotes
   between opener and closer that don't qualify as closers get
   backslash-escaped. Also escapes raw newlines inside strings.

Saves ~30s of round-trip latency per recovered call on a 4B-class
model. Idempotent on already-valid JSON.

## Bench progression — rung-3 over the day

## Open problems (as of 2026-04-23 PM end-of-day)

### O1 — Helper deletion in test files — Y CLOSED by G7

Worker drops `db` fixture + sibling tests when emitting
`tests/test_db.py`. G7 AST-diff fires on the first attempt and
forces a retry; if the worker repeats the same deletion, retry
exhausts and the subtask cleanly fails with the test file
untouched. Validated live rung-3 v22.

### O2 — qwen3-8b TOML authoring ceiling

qwen3-8b emits invalid TOML on first attempt with high consistency
(observed in v12, v13, v14, v17 — same `Invalid value` errors at
`line 8 col 88` or `line 22 col 10`). The post-write syntax check
catches it; the file stays clean. v17 saw the first ever
`build_retry.success` after a TOML failure (worker fixed duplicate
`[build-system]` on attempt 2), so feedback CAN work — but it's
sporadic.

### O3 — Worker silent JSON-emit failures

qwen3-8b + `/no_think` occasionally fails to produce parseable JSON
even with the in-process repair. Visible as `worker.subtask.failed`
with error `Could not obtain valid JSON from LLM after 3 attempts`.
Dominant residual failure family on rung-3 today.

### O4 — Body-level semantic regression — Y CLOSED by G8 (worker) + G8-on-refiner

Worker preserves function signatures but rewrites bodies in ways
that break callers (e.g. drops `row_factory = sqlite3.Row`; injects
stray characters into string literals). G8 runtime test gate
catches this at the only layer where it's visible: running tests.

G8 was originally wired only to the WORKER apply path. Rung-3 v24
(first Mac run with Occam feedback loop) exposed the gap: the
REFINER phase has its own apply path without G8. Refiner injected
a stray `>` into `init_schema`'s SQL string — valid Python, valid
AST, but sqlite3 errors at DDL execution → 4/4 tests broken.
Fixed in commit `c2e3af6`: refiner apply captures a test baseline
before its patches, re-runs tests after syntax+AST both pass,
and resets to v0 + skips meta-eval when regressions are detected.

Validated live rung-3 v25 — `critic_test_regression.fail
phase=refiner sample=tests/test_db.py::test_find_known_user
total_count=4` fired, refiner reverted, worker's correct fix
shipped. 4/4 tests green.

## Feedback loop integration (Occam Observer)

Starting commit `49c1d57` gitoma speaks to a separate Go gateway
(Occam Observer) that aggregates observations across runs. Two
directions:

- **WRITE — `POST /observation`** after every subtask in
  `on_subtask_done` / `on_subtask_error`. Payload:
  `{run_id (=branch), agent:"gitoma", subtask_id, model,
  outcome (success|fail|skipped), touched_files, failure_modes,
  confidence}`. `failure_modes` is a closed set of 11 labels
  (`json_emit`, `ast_diff`, `test_regression`, `syntax_invalid`,
  `denylist`, `manifest_block`, `patcher_reject`,
  `build_retry_exhausted`, `git_refused`, `json_parse_bad`,
  `unknown`) mapped from error strings by
  `map_error_to_failure_modes`.

- **READ — `GET /repo/agent-log?since=24h&limit=20`** right before
  `planner.plan()`. Results render into a `== PRIOR RUNS CONTEXT ==`
  block in the planner user prompt, grouped by outcome (FAILED
  first since that's the actionable "don't re-propose" signal).

Validated end-to-end rung-3 v23 → v25: 31 observations landed
across 3 runs, 4 distinct failure_modes surfaced live, planner
console announced `Occam: injected N prior-runs entries into
planner context` on each run after the first.

Observed limitation (v24): soft prompt injection ("AVOID these
patterns") is too gentle for a 4B-class planner. It reshapes the
subtask title but keeps identical `file_hints`, so the worker hits
the same slop. Deterministic post-plan filter (reject subtasks
whose file_hints overlap with recent-failed file_hints) is the
likely next guard.

Feature off when `OCCAM_URL` env var is unset. Client
fail-open on every network / schema / gateway error — gitoma
pipeline runs unchanged without Occam.

## Composability model

The guards are layered, not optional. Every patch flows through:

```
worker prompt (G4+G5)
  → LLM call (JSON repair)
    → patcher (G1)
      → syntax check (G2+G6)
        → BuildAnalyzer
          → critic phases
```

Each layer catches a specific shape of failure. A single layer is
necessary but not sufficient — v15's first-ever fully-green PR
required all five layers shipped at the time. A regression in any
layer (e.g. a new model that produces a new failure shape) doesn't
require redesigning others; we just add a new guard alongside the
existing ones.

| 2026-04-23 PM | v23 launch | Occam Observer P1 integration (commit `49c1d57`) — `POST /observation` after every subtask + `GET /repo/agent-log` pre-planner. Feature off when `OCCAM_URL` unset. |
| 2026-04-23 PM | v25 launch | G8 extended to refiner apply path (commit `c2e3af6`) — `critic_test_regression.fail phase=refiner` → v0 reset. Caught the v16/v24 `>`-in-SQL-string pattern that G6/G7 miss by design. **Third 4/4 green ENGINEERED run.** |
| 2026-04-23 PM | v27 launch | G9 deterministic post-plan filter (commits `e2e9a04` + `a17ebc3` + `d7ee293`) — drops subtasks with recently-failing `file_hints` at plan time. Wider 7d/200 window than planner prompt (24h/20). **Cleanest rung-3 run of the day** — 1 worker fail vs usual 3-5. |
| 2026-04-23 PM | b2v PR #19 | G10 (semantic config schema validator) — bundled schemastore.org schemas for ESLint/Prettier/package.json/tsconfig/github-workflow/dependabot/Cargo. Catches valid-JSON-but-wrong-shape configs that G2 silently passes. v0.2.0 release. |
| 2026-04-23 PM | b2v PR #21 | G11 (content-grounding via Occam `/repo/fingerprint`) — new endpoint exposes declared deps + inferred frameworks; planner prompt + worker apply loop both consume it. Catches the React-in-Rust-repo hallucination that every prior guard misses by design. |
| 2026-04-24 AM | b2v PR #21 second issue | G12 (config-grounding for JS/TS configs) — closes the OTHER half of PR #21: `prettier.config.js` referenced `prettier-plugin-tailwindcss` not in npm deps. Same fingerprint as G11; 47-basename closed-set, 3 extractors (require/import/plugin-array). Live-validated against b2v fingerprint. |
| 2026-04-25 AM | b2v PRs #24/#26/#27 | G13 (doc-preservation) — README destruction recurred in 3 of 4 shipped PRs across all model sizes (gemma-2B/4B + qwen3-8B). Two deterministic checks: code-block char preservation + literal `\n` corruption signature. Closes a class self-review caught only 1 of 4 times. |
| 2026-04-25 AM | b2v PRs #24/#27 | G14 (URL/path grounding) — closes the content-grounding trilogy after G11/G12/G13. Two-tier external URL check (DNS → HEAD-404) catches invented `*.github.io` subdomains; relative-path filesystem check catches invented `docs/guide/code/*` paths. Carry-over links exempt. Opt-out via `GITOMA_URL_GROUNDING_OFFLINE`. |
| 2026-04-25 PM | rung-0 backlog + b2v PR matrix | Layer-A `synthesize_real_bug_task` + Layer-B `banish_readme_only_subtasks` — deterministic plan post-processors that fire BEFORE worker apply. A: synthesize T000 when planner ignored failing tests. B: drop README-only subtasks unless Documentation metric explicitly cites README. Plus planner-prompt HARD RULE on README. Catches the planner-side root cause of 3 of 4 b2v PR README destructions. |
| 2026-04-26 AM | b2v bench replay + horizon-Ψ memory | Ψ-lite (`gitoma/worker/psi_score.py`) — pure-math Γ (grounding fraction) + Ω (slop heuristics) → `Ψ = α·Γ - λ·Ω`. Scalar gate between structural guards and LLM critics. Opt-in via `GITOMA_PSI_LITE=on`. Calibrated against PR #27 (README destroyed: Ψ=0.40 → BLOCK) vs PR #28/#29/#30 clean (Ψ ≥ 0.935 → PASS). |
| 2026-04-27 PM | bench-blast PR #1 | G20 (TOML/INI syntax validator) — stdlib `tomllib` + `configparser` over every touched config file in the patch. Closes the failure mode where 3 syntax errors slipped past G1–G15 + LLM self-critic. Wired between G15 and G18/G19; same revert+retry shape. 43 tests including replay of bench-blast `setup.cfg` failure. Defaults on, no env toggle. |
| 2026-04-27 PM | post-G19 backfill | G16 (dead-code-introduction) — completes the orphan-symbol family alongside G18 (abandoned) + G19 (echo). Flags new public symbols with ZERO callers anywhere. Test files exempted via shared `_is_test_file` heuristic across Python/TS/TSX/JS/Go/Rust naming conventions. Opt-in `GITOMA_G16_DEAD_CODE=on` (false-positive risk on framework reflection / public lib API / plugin hooks). 24 new tests. |
